#  Smart Training Platform â€“ Java Trainer Machine Test

A Spring Boot-based training batch management system with automatic trainer allocation and batch recommendations for students.

---

##  Project Overview

This project was created as part of the Java Trainer Machine Test. It includes RESTful APIs to manage students, trainers, and batches, with added business logic to:

- Automatically assign the best available trainer to a batch
- Recommend suitable batches to students based on subject, past courses, and availability

---

## Features

-  Student, Trainer, and Batch entity modeling
-  Smart trainer assignment algorithm
-  Batch recommendation logic for students
-  CRUD APIs for all entities
-  Validation and exception handling
-  Docker support
-  Deployed live on Render

##  Questions 

### 1. What is Dependency Injection and how is it used in your app?

Dependency Injection is a way to give an object what it needs from outside instead of creating it itself. It helps in writing clean, testable code  


Example:
```java
public StudentController(StudentService studentService) {
    this.studentService = studentService;
}
```

### 2. How would you explain the trainer assignment logic to students?
The trainer assignment logic follows these steps:

Filter trainers who are experts in the batch subject.

Exclude trainers who are already booked during the batch period.

Sort remaining trainers:

Highest rating first

Then by lowest workload (fewer batches assigned)

### 3. Why did you choose your architecture and flow?
I used a layered architecture with:

Controller â†’ handles HTTP requests

Service â†’ contains business logic

Repository â†’ handles database operations

This keeps code organized, testable, and easy to extend. It also follows industry-standard practices for Spring Boot apps.


### API Endpoints
## Student
POST /api/students â€“ Add student

GET /api/students/{id} â€“ Get student by ID

PUT /api/students/{id} â€“ Update student

DELETE /api/students/{id} â€“ Delete student

GET /api/students/{id}/recommendations â€“ Get batch recommendations for student

##  Trainer
POST /api/trainers â€“ Add trainer

(You can add more trainer endpoints as needed)

## Batch
POST /api/batches â€“ Add batch

GET /api/batches/subject/{subject} â€“ Get batches by subject

POST /api/batches/{batchId}/assign-trainer â€“ Assign best trainer to batch
